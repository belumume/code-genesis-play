# Game Design Document: **Stellar Drift**

## 1. Game Title and Concept

**Title:** Stellar Drift

**Concept:** A fast-paced arcade space shooter where players pilot a nimble spacecraft through increasingly dangerous asteroid fields while collecting power-ups to enhance their ship and survive as long as possible.

**Core Loop:** Dodge → Collect → Upgrade → Survive

## 2. Core Mechanics

### Movement System
- **360° Movement:** Ship moves freely in all directions
- **Momentum-based physics:** Ship maintains velocity when not accelerating
- **Boost mechanic:** Limited boost meter for quick escapes

### Asteroid Behavior
- **Dynamic spawning:** Asteroids spawn from screen edges with increasing frequency
- **Size varieties:** Small (fast), Medium (moderate), Large (slow but dangerous)
- **Destructible:** Large asteroids break into smaller pieces when shot

### Power-Up System
| Power-Up | Effect | Duration |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Shield | Absorbs 3 hits | Until depleted |
| Rapid Fire | 3x fire rate | 15 seconds |
| Time Warp | Slows asteroids 50% | 10 seconds |
| Magnet | Auto-collects nearby items | 20 seconds |
| Laser Beam | Piercing continuous beam | 12 seconds |

### Scoring System
- Survival time: +10 points/second
- Asteroid destroyed: Small (50), Medium (100), Large (200)
- Power-up collected: +250 points
- Near-miss bonus: +25 points for close dodges

- **Color Palette:** Deep space blacks, bright neon accents (cyan, magenta, yellow)
- **Effects:** Glowing particle trails, dynamic lighting, screen shake on impacts

### Visual Elements
- **Ship Design:** Sleek, angular spacecraft with customizable color schemes
- **Asteroids:** Procedurally textured space rocks with glowing cracks
- **Background:** Parallax star fields with distant nebulae
- **UI:** Minimalist HUD with holographic elements

### Visual Feedback
