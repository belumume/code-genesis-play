# Game Design Document: Stellar Drift

## 1. Game Title and Concept

### Title
**Stellar Drift: Cosmic Survivor**

### Concept Overview
Stellar Drift is a fast-paced arcade space shooter where players pilot a nimble spacecraft through increasingly dangerous asteroid fields while collecting power-ups to enhance their ship's capabilities. The game combines classic dodge-and-survive gameplay with modern progression systems and vibrant visual effects.

### Core Gameplay Loop
- Navigate through procedurally generated asteroid fields
- Collect power-ups to upgrade weapons and abilities
- Survive as long as possible while achieving high scores
- Unlock new ships and permanent upgrades

## 2. Core Mechanics

### Movement System
- **360-degree movement**: Ship can move freely in all directions
- **Momentum-based physics**: Ship maintains velocity when not actively thrusting
- **Boost mechanic**: Limited boost meter for quick escapes
- **Drift control**: Players can rotate ship independently of movement direction

### Asteroid Behavior
- **Size variations**: Small (fast), Medium (moderate), Large (slow)
- **Destruction mechanics**: Large asteroids break into smaller ones when shot
- **Dynamic spawning**: Difficulty increases over time with more frequent spawns
- **Special asteroids**: 
  - Ice asteroids that slow the ship
  - Explosive asteroids that damage nearby objects
  - Gold asteroids that drop bonus points

### Power-Up System
#### Temporary Power-Ups (30-second duration)
- **Triple Shot**: Fires three projectiles in a spread pattern
- **Laser Beam**: Continuous damage beam
- **Shield**: Absorbs one asteroid hit
- **Time Slow**: Reduces game speed by 50%
- **Magnet**: Attracts nearby collectibles

#### Permanent Upgrades (Between runs)
- Ship armor upgrades
- Weapon damage increases
- Boost capacity improvements
- Starting power-up duration

### Scoring System
- Base points for survival time (10 points/second)
- Asteroid destruction (50-200 points based on size)
- Power-up collection (100 points)
- Combo multiplier for consecutive asteroid destructions
- Near-miss bonus for close asteroid dodges
