# AI Genesis Engine - Project Summary

## Current Status: **MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS IMPLEMENTED** ✅

### 🎯 Project Overview

**AI Genesis Engine** is a **multi-agent system** that transforms single-sentence prompts into complete, playable JavaScript/HTML5 games using Claude AI. Built for the **$40,000 AI Showdown**, this project demonstrates autonomous AI collaboration with enterprise-grade security.

**Current Architecture:** Multi-Agent System with React/TypeScript frontend + Python/FastAPI backend  
**Output Format:** JavaScript/HTML5 games (p5.js)  
**Competition Deadline:** Monday June 16th at 9AM CET  
**Latest Update:** Critical security fixes and enhanced browser testing implemented  

### ✅ **FIXES IMPLEMENTED (Just Now)**

#### 🔒 **Security Hardening COMPLETE**
- ✅ **CORS Fixed** - Removed wildcard, now using specific allowed origins only
- ✅ **Rate Limiting** - Implemented 30 requests/minute per IP address
- ✅ **Input Sanitization** - Comprehensive prompt validation with XSS protection
- ✅ **Security Headers** - Added CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, XSS protection

#### 🧪 **Enhanced Testing System**
- ✅ **Playwright Integration** - Sentry Agent now supports real browser testing
- ✅ **Comprehensive Validation** - Syntax + browser-based game testing
- ✅ **Detailed Error Reports** - Console errors, runtime errors, and warnings
- ✅ **Fallback Testing** - Enhanced static analysis when Playwright unavailable

#### 🎮 **Frontend Improvements**
- ✅ **HTML Game Preview** - Fixed with proper iframe sandbox implementation
- ✅ **File Viewer Enhanced** - Syntax highlighting + in-modal game preview
- ✅ **Authentication Fix** - Resolved redirect loop issue
- ✅ **Play Options** - Both preview and new tab game launching

### 🚀 **REMAINING TASKS** (Next 1-2 Hours)

#### **Phase 1: Testing & Validation (30 minutes)**
1. Run security test suite to verify all fixes
2. Test end-to-end game generation with new Sentry
3. Verify HTML game preview works properly
4. Test rate limiting and input sanitization

#### **Phase 2: Deployment Updates (30 minutes)**
1. Update Render deployment with new dependencies
2. Install Playwright browsers on production
3. Verify all environment variables are set
4. Test production deployment

#### **Phase 3: Competition Materials (60 minutes)**
1. Record demo video showcasing multi-agent system
2. Highlight browser-based testing feature
3. Update submission documents
4. Final testing and polish
