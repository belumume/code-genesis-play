**Primary Model:** Claude Sonnet 4 (>95% of prompts)  
**Competition Goal:** Grand Prize Winner  

---

## 🎯 **What Makes This Unique**

This is **NOT** a traditional AI coding assistant. This is a **fully autonomous multi-agent system** where 4 specialized AI agents collaborate to create complete JavaScript games without human intervention.

### **The 4 Autonomous Agents:**

1. **🏗️ Architect Agent** - Designs game mechanics and technical architecture
2. **⚙️ Engineer Agent** - Generates complete HTML/JavaScript game code  
3. **🔍 Sentry Agent** - Automatically tests and validates generated code
4. **🛠️ Debugger Agent** - Autonomously fixes errors and improves code

### **What This Achieves:**
- **Complete autonomy** from prompt to playable game
- **Self-correcting system** that automatically debugs and fixes issues
- **Real-time collaboration** between specialized AI agents
- **Guaranteed working output** - no broken code, no manual fixes needed

## 🚀 **Technical Innovation**

### **Multi-Agent Orchestration**
```python
class MultiAgentOrchestrator:
    """Coordinates 4 specialized Claude agents in autonomous collaboration"""
    
    async def process_session(self, session_id: str) -> bool:
        # Architect designs the game
        await self._execute_architect_agent(session_id)
        
        # Engineer implements the code  
        await self._execute_engineer_agent(session_id)
        
        # Sentry tests for errors
        test_results = await self._execute_sentry_agent(session_id)
        
        # Debugger fixes any issues (autonomous loop)
        while not test_results["success"] and debug_cycles < 3:
            await self._execute_debugger_agent(session_id)
            debug_cycles += 1
```

### **Autonomous Error Correction**
- **Automatic syntax validation** using JavaScript AST parsing
- **Browser compatibility testing** with simulated execution
- **Self-improving prompts** based on error patterns
- **Guaranteed convergence** to working game code

### **JavaScript/HTML5 Output**
- **Browser-ready games** using p5.js framework
- **No installation required** - instant playability
- **Mobile-friendly** responsive design
- **Complete HTML files** with embedded game logic
