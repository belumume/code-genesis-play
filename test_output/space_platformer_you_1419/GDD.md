# Game Design Document: Crystal Voyager

## 1. Game Title and Concept

### Title
**Crystal Voyager: Alien Odyssey**

### Concept Overview
Crystal Voyager is a 2.5D space platformer where players control an intrepid astronaut explorer navigating through alien-infested space stations and asteroid colonies. The primary objective is to collect rare Quantum Crystals while avoiding or outsmarting hostile alien creatures. Set in a vibrant, retro-futuristic universe, the game combines classic platforming mechanics with gravity-defying space physics and strategic resource management.

### Core Premise
You play as Nova, a crystal prospector whose ship has crash-landed in the dangerous Andromeda Sector. To repair your vessel and return home, you must venture through increasingly treacherous alien territories to collect Quantum Crystalsâ€”the galaxy's most valuable energy source. But you're not alone; the indigenous alien species view you as an invader and will stop at nothing to protect their crystal deposits.

## 2. Core Mechanics

### Movement Mechanics
- **Gravity Manipulation**: Players can toggle between normal and low-gravity modes
- **Jet Pack Boost**: Limited fuel-based vertical and horizontal propulsion
- **Wall Jumping**: Bounce between surfaces to reach higher platforms
- **Magnetic Boots**: Temporarily stick to metallic surfaces and walk on ceilings

### Collection System
- **Quantum Crystals**: Primary collectible (3 tiers: Blue, Purple, Gold)
- **Crystal Fragments**: Secondary currency for upgrades
- **Power Cells**: Restore jet pack fuel
- **Shield Orbs**: Temporary invincibility power-ups

### Combat/Avoidance Mechanics
- **Stealth Mode**: Temporary invisibility cloak with cooldown
- **EMP Blast**: Stuns mechanical enemies for 3 seconds
- **Decoy Beacon**: Distracts aliens for strategic maneuvering
- **Environmental Hazards**: Use laser grids, airlocks, and gravity wells against enemies

### Progression System
- **Upgrade Tree**: Enhance jet pack capacity, movement speed, and special abilities
- **Crystal Banking**: Safe zones where collected crystals are permanently saved
- **Checkpoint System**: Respawn points that maintain crystal progress
