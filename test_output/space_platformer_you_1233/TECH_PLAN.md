## 2. Core Classes and Functions
- `main.py`: Entry point of the game, handles game loop and main menu.
- `game.py`: Manages game states, level loading, and game progress.
  - `run()`: Main game loop.
  - `load_level(level_id)`: Loads a level from a JSON file.
  - `update()`: Updates game state and handles collisions.
  - `draw()`: Renders game objects on the screen.
- `player.py`: Defines the player character and its behaviors.
  - `update()`: Updates player position and handles input.
  - `draw()`: Renders the player character on the screen.
  - `handle_collision(object)`: Handles player collisions with game objects.
- `enemy.py`: Defines enemy characters and their AI.
  - `update()`: Updates enemy position and AI behavior.
  - `draw()`: Renders the enemy character on the screen.
- `level.py`: Represents a game level and its properties.
  - `load(file_path)`: Loads level data from a JSON file.
  - `update()`: Updates level state and checks for completion.
  - `draw()`: Renders level background and objects on the screen.
- `crystal.py`: Defines the collectable crystal objects.
  - `update()`: Updates crystal state and animations.
  - `draw()`: Renders the crystal on the screen.
- `power_up.py`: Defines power-up objects and their effects.
  - `apply(player)`: Applies power-up effect to the player.
  - `draw()`: Renders the power-up on the screen.
- `boss.py`: Defines boss characters and their behaviors.
  - `update()`: Updates boss position, AI, and attack patterns.
  - `draw()`: Renders the boss character on the screen.
- `utilities.py`: Contains utility functions for asset loading, collision detection, and screen transitions.

## 3. Implementation Order
1. Set up project structure and Pygame environment.
2. Implement `main.py` and `game.py` with basic game loop and state management.
3. Create `player.py` and implement player movement and controls.
4. Develop `level.py` and implement level loading from JSON files.
5. Implement `crystal.py` and crystal collection mechanics.
6. Create `enemy.py` and implement basic enemy AI and behaviors.
7. Implement `power_up.py` and power-up mechanics.
8. Develop `boss.py` and create boss battles for each world.
9. Implement game UI, menus, and screen transitions.
10. Polish game visuals, add sound effects and music.
11. Test, debug, and optimize game performance.

## 4. Key Technical Challenges
- Smooth and responsive character movement and collision detection.
- Implementing diverse enemy AI and attack patterns.
- Creating engaging and challenging level designs.
- Developing a robust level loading system using JSON files.
- Optimizing game performance for smooth gameplay.

## 5. Dependencies and Libraries
- Python 3.7+
- Pygame 2.0+
- SDL2 (dependency of Pygame)
- numpy (for efficient data manipulation)

Additional tools:
- Tiled (for level design and tilemap creation)
- Aseprite (for pixel art asset creation)

The game will be developed using Python and the Pygame library, leveraging its capabilities for 2D game development. JSON files will be used to store level data, allowing for easy level creation and modification. The game assets, including sprites and tilesets, will be created using tools such as Aseprite.

To ensure smooth performance, the game will utilize efficient collision detection techniques and optimize rendering by only updating visible portions of the screen. The game will also employ a level loading system that allows for the creation of diverse and engaging levels using JSON files.
