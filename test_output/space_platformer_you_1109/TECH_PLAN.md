# Technical Implementation Plan

## Architecture Overview
Component-based game architecture with clear separation of concerns.

## File Structure
```
main.py              # Complete game implementation
```

## Core Classes

### Game
- Main game controller
- Handles initialization, game loop, and shutdown
- Manages all game objects and state

### Player
- Player character with position and velocity
- Handles input and movement physics
- Collision detection with environment

### Platform
- Static platform objects for level geometry
- Simple rectangle collision bounds

### Collectible
- Items for player to collect
- Collision detection and collection logic

### Enemy
- Basic enemy with simple AI
- Collision detection with player

## Implementation Sequence
1. **Phase 1:** Basic Pygame window and main loop
2. **Phase 2:** Player character with movement
3. **Phase 3:** Platform level geometry
4. **Phase 4:** Collision detection system
5. **Phase 5:** Collectibles and win condition
6. **Phase 6:** Enemies and lose condition
7. **Phase 7:** Game over screens and restart

## Dependencies
- pygame: Game engine and graphics
- typing: Type hints for clean code
- sys: Clean application exit

## Placeholder Graphics
- Player: Blue rectangle (32x48 pixels)
- Platforms: Green rectangles (various sizes)
- Collectibles: Yellow circles (16 pixel radius)
- Enemies: Red rectangles (24x24 pixels)
- Background: Light blue solid color
