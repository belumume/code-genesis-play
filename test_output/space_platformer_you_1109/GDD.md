- **Dependencies:** pygame only

## Implementation Priority
1. Basic window and main game loop
2. Player character (blue rectangle) with movement
3. Platform environment (green rectangles)
4. Gravity and jumping mechanics
5. Collectible items (yellow circles)
6. Basic collision detection
7. Win/lose conditions and game over screen
